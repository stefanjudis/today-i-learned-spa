# Today I learned (as a Single Page Application)

or ... a **"Netlify Contentful React example"**

![The Today I learned site](./screenshot.png)

_This project is based on [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)._

## Features

- an automatic content model setup for a quick-start in Contentful
- dynamic rendering and usage of the [Contentful Preview API](https://www.contentful.com/developers/docs/references/content-preview-api/) for easier content preview in development
- static builds for better user experience using [react-snap](https://github.com/stereobooster/react-snap)
- deploys and CI-flow in Netlify

## Requirements

### [Contentful](https://www.contentful.com) – your Content Infrastructure

Contentful’s content infrastructure is a set of APIs to read, write and preview your data combined with [developer friendly CLI tools](https://github.com/contentful/contentful-cli/) and an [extensible web application](https://www.contentful.com/developers/docs/concepts/uiextensions/) to provide a smooth editorial experience. This set of APIs makes it a perfect fit for modern static site generators that are able to consume API data easily.

### [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com) – your CI service and hoster

Netlify enables an all-in-one workflow that combines global deployment, continuous integration, and automatic HTTPS.

## Project setup and initial deploy using the Netlify Deploy Button

[![Deploy to Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/img/deploy/button.svg)](https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/stefanjudis/today-i-learned-spa)

This project can be used without files on any computer simply by configuring Contentful and Netlify. The tutorial is [included in the project itself](https://today-i-learned.netlify.com/tutorial/). Go there and have a look in case you have any questions

### Setup of the project for local development

```
$ git clone git@github.com:stefanjudis/today-i-learned-spa.git
$ cd today-i-learned
$ npm i
$ mv .env.sample .env
```

Edit the `.env` to include Contentful credentials of the space you created for the initial flow.

```
REACT_APP_CTF_SPACE=...
REACT_APP_CTF_CDA_TOKEN=...
REACT_APP_CTF_CPA_TOKEN=...
```

### npm start

`npm start` will start a new development server with hot reloading. The cool thing about this command is that the React applications knows that you are in development and uses the [Content Preview API](https://www.contentful.com/developers/docs/references/content-preview-api/). This means, that you will see unpublished and updated data in development which is great to evaluate content changes.

### npm run build

`npm run build` generates a production read bundle including all the CSS and JavaScript and also uses [react-snap](https://github.com/stereobooster/react-snap) to generate static HTML files for every route it can find. This way you don't have to show a loading spinner when you users load the site but rather show the rendered HTML already.
